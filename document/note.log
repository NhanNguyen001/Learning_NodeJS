Each function gets its own scope

validator: just a really function which should return true or false and if it returns false, then it means there is an error
 
Hasing algorithm called bcrypt: this algorithm will first salt then hash our password in order to make it really strong to protect it against bruteforce attacks.

Salt - it's gonna add a random string to the password so that two equal passwords do not generate the same hash 

Bruteforce attacks could try to guess a certain passwords if it's not really strong encrypted

all communication must happen over https so secure encrypted http in order to prevent that anyone can get access to passwords or Json Web Tokens


Using the standard HSA 256 encryption for the signature, the secret should

Everything related to passwords and to the user we have to use save()
