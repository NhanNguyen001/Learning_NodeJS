scope (technically called lexical scope): is basically a collection of variable as well as the rules for how those varibales are accessed by name.
Each function gets its own scope

validator: just a really function which should return true or false and if it returns false, then it means there is an error
 
Hasing algorithm called bcrypt: this algorithm will first salt then hash our password in order to make it really strong to protect it against bruteforce attacks.

salt - it's gonna add a random string to the password so that two equal passwords do not generate the same hash 

Bruteforce attacks could try to guess a certain passwords if it's not really strong encrypted
